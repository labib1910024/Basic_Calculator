# Simple Web Calculator

This is a basic calculator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It supports four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Input two numbers (A and B)
- Perform:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (−)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
- Displays the result in a read-only field
- Clean and responsive UI with gradient background and hover effects

## Live Demo

You can open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see it in action.


## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Input two numeric values.
3. Click on the desired operation:
   - `Add(+)`
   - `Sub(-)`
   - `Mul(x)`
   - `Div(/)`
4. The result will be displayed in the "Answer" field.


## Notes

- Handles only integer arithmetic.
- No input validation or division-by-zero handling is currently implemented.
- Can be extended to support floating-point numbers or keyboard input.

## Improvements You Can Make

- Add error handling (e.g., division by zero).
- Support decimals (`parseFloat` instead of `parseInt`).
- Add keyboard support.
- Style improvements using CSS Flexbox or Grid.
- Mobile responsiveness tweaks.
